# Graph Traversal Library

## Overview
This project is a generic Java library for creating and managing directed graphs. It includes features for adding nodes and edges, traversing the graph using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), and finding paths between nodes. It supports custom data types for nodes, making it highly versatile and reusable.

## Features
### Graph Operations:
- Add nodes and edges.
- Retrieve all nodes or neighbors of a specific node.

### Graph Traversal:
- Perform DFS and BFS starting from any node.

### Pathfinding:
- Find a path between two nodes using Breadth-First Search.

### Graph Management:
- Reset the graph by clearing all nodes and edges.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular design using Java interfaces and classes:
- `GraphTraversalKernel`: Defines core operations like adding nodes and edges, retrieving nodes, and traversing the graph.
- `GraphTraversalSecondary`: Extends the kernel with additional functionality, such as finding paths and resetting the graph.
- `GraphTraversal`: Implements all the features, backed by an adjacency list representation.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### Folder Structure
GraphTraversalProject/ ├── src/ │ └── com/ │ └── example/ │ └── graph/ │ ├── GraphTraversalKernel.java │ ├── GraphTraversalSecondary.java │ ├── GraphTraversal.java


### Build and Run

1. Navigate to the `src` directory:
   ```bash
  cd src

2. Compile the project
   javac com/example/graph/*.java

3. Run the program

## Future Improvements
- Add support for weighted edges to handle graphs with edge weights.
- Implement shortest path algorithms, such as:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* (A-Star) Algorithm
- Provide visualization tools to render the graph structure visually.
- Extend support for undirected graphs in addition to directed graphs.
- Optimize traversal methods for better performance with large graphs.
